This repository demonstrates a common error in Java programming: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index, resulting in a runtime exception. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.java`, demonstrates the correct way to iterate through an array and avoid this error. The key change is in the for loop condition; it must be `i < arr.length` rather than `i <= arr.length`. This repository is intended for educational purposes, showcasing a frequent error and its proper solution in a clear and concise manner.
